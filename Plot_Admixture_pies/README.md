Data and R script for plotting admixture pie charts in Figure 2A and 2B, as well as Supplementary Text S1 figures E, F, G and H.

Note that the placement of the pies on the plots (in all figures apart frm 2B) was determined based on the shape of the Neighbor-Net network. The network was generated manually in SplitsTree by load in the distance matrix file (also provided here), and exporting as svg, from which the tip coordinates were extracted manually (it was a fair amount of manual text editing).
